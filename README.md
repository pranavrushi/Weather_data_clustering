The **minute weather dataset** comes from the same source as the daily weather dataset that we used in the decision tree based classifier notebook. The main difference between these two datasets is that the minute weather dataset contains raw sensor measurements captured at one-minute intervals. Daily weather dataset instead contained processed and well curated data. The data is in the file **minute_weather.csv**, which is a comma-separated file.

As with the daily weather data, this data comes from a weather station located in San Diego, California. The weather station is equipped with sensors that capture weather-related measurements such as air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. Data was collected for a period of three years, from September 2011 to September 2014, to ensure that sufficient data for different seasons and weather conditions is captured.
